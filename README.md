# Modelska-analiza-2

This are projects for the class Modelska analiza 2 (Model analysis 2).
Unfortunately they are in Slovene. A fast summary:
1. Planet moving around sun, numerical errors, orbits, drifting of orbits. Comparison of different integration methods (Euler, Leapfrog, Runge-Kutta). When alien planet passes through planetary system.
2. Differential equations with boundary conditions. A rope on a spinning rod fixed on both ends. Poincaré map for star in a "galaxy". Periodic orbits from a Poincaré map.
3. Eigenstates and Eigenenergies for hydrogen atom's Schrödinger equation with shooting method. Solving of Helmholtz equation.
4. Hartree-Fock method.
5. Partial differential equations (PDE): (chapter 1) Boundary problems and relaxation. Calculating Poiseuille coefficient for different                                             shapes of pipes, solving Poisson equation with SOR.
                                         (chapter 2) Heat transport on a cylinder.
6. PDE: (chapter 1): Eigenstates on a vibrating homogeneous membrane.
        (chapter 2): Eigenstates on a vibrating inhomogeneous membrane.
        (chapter 3): Eigenstates on a vibrating homogeneous semicircle membrane.
7. Finite Element Method (FEM): Solving Poisson equation. Fluid transport through semicircle shaped pipe.
8. FEM: Eigenstates on vibrating semicircle membrane.
9. Boundary Element Method (BEM): (chapter 1) Electric field in 2D of charged strip.
                                  (chapter 2) Velocity profile of a fluid around a shape (2D)
10. Direct method for solving Poisson equation (with Fourier transform).
11. Movement of inelastic rope.
12. Solving Navier–Stokes system of equations.

13. Zaključna_naloga_Miha_srdinšek.
Final project for the class Model Analysis 2. Poincaré map for point moving on a surface described by a membrane in gravitational field.

14.TDS.
Project for different class. Where I had to construct the Poincaré map of a system of two spinning tops (equation of first page).
