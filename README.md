# Modelska-analiza-2

This are projects for the class Modelska analiza 2 (Model analysis 2)
Unfortunaly they are in slovene. A fast summary:
1. Analitical treatment of driving on road with trafic lights. With the help of variational principle.
2. Optimization with linear programing. We had to construct A optimal diet from given list of foods.
3. Thomson problem with numerical minimization.
4. Simple population models: -foxes and rabbits (page 2)
                             -laser with constant source from exitations (page 6)
                             -model of epidemy, taking in account immunity (page 12)
5. Moddeling of chemical reactions
6. Linear fitting on data with different polinomials (Hermit, Legendre, Tchebishe). 
7. Nonlinear fitting.
8. Generators of random numbers. How to construct your own generator of gaussian numbers. How to construct random numbers with given distribution. Statistical tests.
9. Integration Monte Carlo. Monte Carlo simulation of black body radiation of translucent ball. Monte Carlo simulation of neutron scattering on thin surface.
10. Metropolis algorithm or simulated annealing. Cooling of molecular chain in gravitational field, ground state of 2D Ising model, and Travelling salesman problem for chinese cities (taking in acount also natural bariers etc.)
11. Stochastic population models. (chapter 1) When will populations go extict for models with only deaths, with deaths and births.
                                  (chapter 2) Population models with Stochastic matrix .
                                  (chapter 3) Again rabbits and foxes model but now a stochastic one. Finding population that lives the
                                  longest by try and error method.
12. Analysis of a spectra with FFT. Deducing initial signal from white noise for 1D and 2D signal.
13. Method of maximal enthropy. Linear interpolation.

(Code is also published, but is not clean enough. I will clean it when I will have time. For each project I had only 10 days and was a bit slopy. I can write much nicer code, as you can se in Advanced computational methods and even newer projects like master thesis.)
